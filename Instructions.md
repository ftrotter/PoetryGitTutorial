Github Branching Excercise
=======================

* Your github user has been invited to have access to this repo. You will need to check the email associated with your github user and agree to access. This tutorial will not work until you are a 'collaborator' on this project!! [You can also approve the inivitation directly here](https://github.com/ftrotter/PoetryGitTutorial/invitations). 
* In order to complete this tutorial, you will need to download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your computer. If you really want to use GNU/Linux for this, you can... but then you will need complete all of the tasks without a GUI..
* Make a branch on this repo. Your branch should begin with your name, and include the purpose of the branch. Something like <yourname>-new-poem sounds right.
* Download this repo to your local machine using Github Desktop. This will download all of the branches on the repo. 
* Switch to the branch on your local repo, create a new file, called <yourname>_poems.md 
* Add a new poem to this file, with your favorite haiku. If you are not in the mood to write a Haiku, then copy one from an online poetry site. If you do that, be sure to include a link to where you found the Haiku. 
* commit your new poem to the local <yourname>-new-poem branch of your local git instance using Github Desktop
* Push your commits to Github.
* On github create a pull request to merge your poem back to the main branch. 
* request that ftrotter review your pull request. 
* Create a new ticket/issue, and assign it ftrotter, and ask that I review your pull request. Your issue should link to your pull request. 
* Once you are done creating your issue.. please send me DM (just to me please do not include Socrates, etc) to let me know you have finished the first part. 

Once you have done this, I will review your pull request and make up some arbitrary reason why the poem cannot be merged back into main... 
Then we will have a conversation, over the github issues and pull request system, in order to get my made-up-compliant "resolved" so that your poem can be merged in. 
This will include [using a commit to close an issue](https://github.blog/2013-01-22-closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) and other methods that are core to the Github workflow process.
