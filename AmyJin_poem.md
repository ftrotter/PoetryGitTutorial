# MARCH
###### Lambs gambol in fields
###### Frisky with the joys of life
###### Bleating happily.

# Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick "A Wonderful Bird is the Pelican"
###### A wonderful bird is the pelican,
###### His bill holds more than his belican.
###### He can take in his beak,
###### Enough food for a week,
###### But I'm damned if I see how the helican.
