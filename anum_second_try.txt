This is a poem.Blue EyesThe rain patters downSending goose bumps across fleshMy blue lips are numbHer azure eyes shineLike crystals catching the sunEven in this rain My hide is soakedIt is on the line for herThe cold bite goes numbDrawn in my jacketHer eyes beaming at meBlue eyed paradise. Vibrant rainforest breathes,Samba rhythms fill the air,Brazil's soul awakes.
